I used datetime library for this problem. After reading the problem I realized I needed a way to compare the dates of the events. I looked up python features related to time and found datetime. With the dates formatted in a comparable way, I could compare the days and the hours in which the tasks began and ended. To see which events overlapped I checked if the start of one event was inside the time period of another event. I made two identical lists with the events and compared each element of the lists but had an if statement preventing the elements from comparing each other.Then I printed all the conflicts. All the edge cases were covered by the conditional nested for loops that I used.
